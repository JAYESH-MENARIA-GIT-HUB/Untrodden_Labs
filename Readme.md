Hello,sir 

I have completed my assignment. Here are the steps I followed.

Os - Linux (google colab)
Libraries - numpy,os,cv2(opencv),tensorflow,keras,matplotlib.
GPU - NVIDIA - K80.

Step 1 . purpose - Create a model for classification of defective product and not defective product.
It is a binary classification problem.

Step 2. Download Dataset - https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1646504822027408&usg=AOvVaw1sOQyYUK4uec3lyDP5vEfd

Step 3. Data augmentation and split the data into training and testing.

Step 4 . Create a model and train using tensorflow. I used a pretrained model for this. I tried some models like - ResNet50,VGG19,InceptionV3,MobileNet,MobileNetV3Small.

But MobileNetV3Small was working fastest with high accuracy and low loss.
Accuracy - 98%.
Loss -  0.048.

Step 5. - Convert the model into tensorflow lite model, because in this case it decreases model size without affecting its accuracy. 

Step 6 . - Recorded a screen video of changing photos and tested on model, and it was working perfectly.

Note : If you have any questions about this project you can call me any time. I can explain this in detail.
